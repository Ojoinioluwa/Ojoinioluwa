## About Me

I'm a dedicated developer focused on building dynamic, responsive, and impactful web and mobile applications. I specialize in the **MERN stack** — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — but I'm currently levelling up with **Go (Golang)** and **PostgreSQL** to master backend performance and microservices architecture.

I thrive on building things from scratch, diving deep into clean code, and contributing to scalable systems. Learning new tools, adopting best practices, and staying curious keeps me sharp and evolving.
